current plan is to use Postgres unless there's a more suitable alternative

proposed table columns
{
Department;		<-- ex. "CSC"
Class Code;		<-- ex. "436"
Class Name;		<-- ex. "Software Development" (That is the name of 436, right?)
Prof. Name;		<-- ex. "R. Sethi"

Schedule; 		<-- data structure that stores day and hour of each class session for detecting conflicts
Prerequisites;		<-- set of class codes that are required to take this class

Current attendance;
Maximum capacity;
Remaining capacity;	<-- (max - cur)
isOpen;			<-- (remaining > 0) #can ppl be added even if the class is closed? what would that return?
}
